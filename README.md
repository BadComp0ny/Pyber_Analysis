# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to compile and review all pyber data between the dates of x and y to identify differences based on location type (urban, suburban, & rural) and make recommendations on ways to potentially increase profits for the company.

## Research
As we compiled the data and as seen in the graphical trends below it is evident that the popularity of the Pyber services increases the closer you get to metropolitan centers.  We saw a peak of 1625 trips in the urban areas, 625 trips in suburban areas (62% decrease in trips) and 125 in rural areas (A drop of almost 94%!).

Finaly in this snapshot of data we saw that the total number of riders vastly decreased as the 



Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
